2023-11-19,"A black chickadee bounces and swirls around a singlet pine branch over and over again near  what sort of looks like a female cardinal.

The movements of the squirrels are so clear as they travel over dropped leaves from the forest. They sound almost like significantly larger animals than they are as the noise is amplified because of the rustling. 

A squirrel eats a nut on a tree branch, I really thought it was making some sort of call but really it’s just it’s teeth on whatever it’s holding. It’s tail wraps up around it. It has sat in this position focused on this singular nut for over 10 minutes straight without moving and only quiets when I take a few steps and it hears me. It sounds like a nail file almost very intense.

Most of the shrubs are losing their color although some continue to have there leaves which are now a yellow brown color.

A small red squirrel tan up and down a tree and quickly through some shrubs. It almost sounded like a bird it had a high pitched squeak. It was much smaller than the other squirrels I’ve seen with a thinner tail but has a orange hint to it’s fur. That was the highlight of my expirrence today, this small squirrel jumped from tree to tree and glided super high in the air and it made the most unique sounds.

Most of the trees remain bare with some small patches of green moss or green grass popping up surrounding them.
